# 🐾 It was once a, or better say THE, Catppuccin Theme
#
# Modified over time to better fit my preferences
# Still named 'catppuccin' cause cats meow.
#
# I began tweaking colors and styles to better suit my preferences 
# but never renamed the theme or its references in the config.
# So if you’re wondering why this Catppuccin 
# no longer looks quite like a cat's mew — it’s because I'm lazy.
#
# It still carries the name out of nostalgia.
