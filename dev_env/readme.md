# Mac Environment Backup & System Health Check Scripts

A set of scripts for backing up and monitoring your macOS development environment, including configurations for various tools, dotfiles, Homebrew packages, and system health checks.

## Features

- **Backup Script:**

  - Backs up:
    - Homebrew packages (formulae and casks)
    - Config directories (.config/\*)
    - Neovim configuration and plugins
    - Various dotfiles (.zshrc, .gitconfig, etc.)
    - Terminal configurations (WezTerm, etc.)
  - Cross-platform restore capability
  - Verification of backed-up files
  - Automatic package manager setup on restore

- **System Health Check Script:**
  - Checks:
    - Installed and outdated Homebrew casks
    - Large files, empty files, and old files
    - Memory usage and compression status
    - CPU usage and active processes
    - Disk space and running services
    - Network status and battery health
    - Security settings (Gatekeeper, SIP, Firewall)
  - Saves a detailed log file in `~/macos-health-logs/`

## Prerequisites

- macOS (for backup and health check)
- Any Unix-like system or Windows with WSL (for restore)
- Bash shell
- `zip` utility (for backup)
- `unzip` utility (for restore)

## Usage

### Backup (macOS only)

```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
./backup.sh
```

This will create a zip file named `mac_env_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip` in your current directory.

### System Health Check (macOS only)

```bash
chmod +x system_health.sh
./system_health.sh
```

This will generate a log file in `~/macos-health-logs/` with detailed system health information.

### Restore (Cross-platform)

```bash
chmod +x restore.sh
./restore.sh <backup_zip_file>
```

## Post-Restore Steps

Depending on your OS:

- macOS: `source ~/.zshrc`
- Linux: `chsh -s $(which zsh)`
- Windows: Consider using WSL for better compatibility

## Customization

To add more directories or files to backup, edit the `CONFIG_DIRS` and `CONFIG_FILES` arrays in `backup.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check file permissions
2. Ensure all required utilities are installed
3. Verify the backup zip file exists and isn't corrupted
4. Check available disk space in the destination
